<p id="content historic ">Muay Thai is an ancient martial art and a national sport in Thailand.<br>
    It is also the most popular sport in South Asia surpassing other<br>
    sports disciplines such as Vietnamese boxing, Burmese boxing,<br>
    Laotian boxing,or even Khmer boxing.The history of Muay Thai is <br>
    intimately linked to that of Thailand.Also called Thai boxing, <br>
    Thai boxing, or Thai boxing,it was practiced for the first time <br>
    by Thai warriors to defend themselves and repel invaders, <br>
    especially the Burmese.

    <br><br>

    It must be recognized that the decision of King "Naresuan the Great" <br>
    to integrate Muay Thai into military training played an important role <br>
    in the promotion of this martial art. Over time, more and more Thais <br>
    learned Muay Thai, which contributed to the development of its techniques.<br>
    In the 18th century, the effectiveness of Muay Thai was demonstrated by the <br>
    famous Thai fighter"Nai Khanom Tom",who was captured by Burmese soldiers <br>
    and who managed to defeat all his opponents in a tournament played <br>
    in front of the king of Burma.Also in the 18th century,Muay Thai <br>
    became a national sport in Thailand following a decision by King <br>
    "Pra Chao Seua", who was nicknamed the Tiger King.

    <br><br>

    The development of tourism in the country, from the 20th century,<br>
    contributed to the export of Muay Thai all over the world, particularly <br>
    in the United States and Europe.Currently, Muay Thai is very popular <br>
    with young Europeans who move to Thailand to learn the techniques<br>
    of this martial art in our Sam Roi Yot training camp!<br>
