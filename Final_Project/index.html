      <h3>Early Career</h3>
      <p>Brown first started racing when he was ten, driving go-karts at King George Speedway before moving to
        dirt track racing, winning the 2006 World Karting Association Mid-South Region Jr. championship. Two years
        later, he won the Jr. Restricted Light and Heavy Division championships, followed by the VDKA Series and Jr.
        Restricted Light and Heavy Division championships in 2009.[2] In 2010, Brown began competing in the Whelen
        All-American Series with family-owned Brandonbilt Motorsports,[3] winning a race and eventually the Virginia
        Rookie of the Year Award.[2] The next year, he won three races at Old Dominion Speedway.[4]</p>
      <h3>Nascar</h3>
      <p>In 2014, Brown made his Camping World Truck Series debut at Iowa Speedway,[4] finishing 25th after
          starting 27th.[5] He made two more starts in the year, with a best finish of 19th at New Hampshire Motor
          Speedway.[6]</p>
      <p>
        The following year, he attempted eight races but failed to qualify for three. After starting the season with a 29th-place finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway,[7] he ended the year with a best finish of 14th at Dover International Speedway.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 2016 season opener at Daytona International Speedway, Brown finished a career-best fourth place.[8] Brown made his Xfinity Series debut at his home track of Richmond International Raceway in September 2016. Brown increased his Xfinity Series schedule in 2017, with intentions of running ten races in addition to select Truck races.
      </p>
      <p>
        After driving a full-time Xfinity Series schedule in 2019 for 2 teams, Brown drove the No. 68 Chevrolet for Brandonbilt Motorsports the following year. He made his first appearance in the NASCAR Xfinity Series playoffs, finishing 12th in the regular-season standings, but was eliminated following the first round.[10]
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, Brown tied his best career finish with a sixth at Daytona,[11] followed by an eighth-place finish at the Daytona Road Course.[12] He improved on his best finish at Phoenix when he finished third after various leaders were forced into the wall on an overtime restart.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Sparks 300 at Talladega in October 2021, Brown was in contention throughout the latter part of the race after escaping the first big wreck that took place on lap 88. As the race started late in the day because of the Truck race that was completed just earlier, there was a chance that the race would be called early if another caution had come out as it was starting to get dark. With a push from behind, Brown, who was not in the playoffs, was able to narrowly get ahead of Brandon Jones and Justin Allgaier in time when the final caution of the race came out with 13 to go due to another big crash. The race was ultimately called with five laps to go due to darkness, and Brown would score his first career Xfinity Series win in his 114th start.
      </p>
      <h3>Let's Go Brandon!</h3>
      <p>After Brandon won the race in October 2021, a crowed of anti Biden people started chanting chanting 'Fuck Joe Biden' - because he is the most effed up president of all times... But when asked, a CNN reporter having a conversation with her friend responded that they were simo=ply chanting Let's Go Brandon. This lead to Let's Go Brandon becoming an anti Biden fraze.</p>
